## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(data.table)
# a data.frame with 1000 rows and randomly assigned groups and values...
set.seed(1)
d <- data.frame(a = sample(letters[1:7], size = 1000, replace = TRUE), 
                b = runif(n = 1000, min = 0, max = 20))
head(d)
aggregate(d$b, list(d$a), mean)
```

```{r}
d_tb <- as_tibble(d)
d_tb
library(dplyr)
d_tb %>% group_by(a) %>% summarize(mean(b))
```

```{r}
d_dt <- data.table(d)
d_dt
d_dt[, mean(b), by = a][order(a)]
```
